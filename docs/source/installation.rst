Installing
==========

.. Note::
  It is good practice to install packages like this in dedicated virtual environments. An example is given in
  the :ref:`run through <on_windows>`.

The package is hosted `on Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/bw2agg/>`_ and can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install bw2preagg

This will also install all dependencies, including `Brightway2 framework <https://brightwaylca.dev/>`_
and `presamples <http://presamples.readthedocs.io/>`_.
